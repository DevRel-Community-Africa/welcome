DevRel Community Africa is a non-profit community of developer relations experts and enthusiasts mainly from all the parts of Africa that exists to share the gospel of developer relations, and help each other learn and grow as much as possible. 

## **Background**
In Nigeria, when I began my tech journey five years ago, there was a lack of structured learning opportunities for coding and design. Additionally, code bootcamps or physical learning platforms were non-existent for individuals seeking to learn these skills. Moreover, the available online courses were prohibitively expensive for many of us, compelling us to rely on each other for learning, sharing free resources, and collectively debugging. 

This experience introduced me to the power of a _"community"_ where we learned from one another and supported each other's growth. Today, many of us who were part of this community have made significant progress in our careers, and it is undeniable that our achievements would have been considerably limited without the support and growth fostered by the community. Thus, having a community of like-minded individuals supporting and nurturing your development holds immense significance.

## **The Mission**
Developer Relations have emerged as a thriving field in the tech industry, with companies increasingly recognizing the value of staying connected with their user community. The pandemic further emphasized the criticality of Developer Relations, leading to a surge in the hiring of developer relations professionals by developer-focused tech companies.

However, despite this global trend, Africa has witnessed limited demand and adoption in the field, and there are few professionals specializing in developer relations from the continent. This is where the transformative power of DevRel Community Africa comes into play.

DevRel Community Africa is a non-profit organization comprising passionate experts and enthusiasts in developer relations from across Africa. Our mission is clear:

- We strive to educate developers and technical writers throughout Africa about the significance of developer advocacy and provide them with guidance to kickstart their careers in this exciting field.

- We organize FREE workshops and engaging meet-ups where top-notch guest speakers from renowned global companies share invaluable insights on essential concepts in Developer Relations and Advocacy.

- We actively assist community members in their professional growth by sharing DevRel job postings, offering CV reviews, and preparing them for interviews, ensuring they stand out in the competitive market.

- We work diligently to persuade African companies to embrace the immense benefits of implementing a robust Developer Relations strategy, fostering stronger bonds between businesses and developers.

- We foster collaboration with other established DevRel communities worldwide, creating a vibrant global network for knowledge sharing and mutual growth.

- Community members enjoy exclusive price discounts on DevRel conferences and courses, enabling them to access valuable resources while advancing their expertise.

Join us on this extraordinary journey as we empower Africa's developer relations ecosystem, unlock opportunities, and nurture a supportive community that thrives on shared knowledge and collective success. Together, we will shape the future of technology in Africa and beyond.
